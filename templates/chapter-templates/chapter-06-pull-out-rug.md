# Chapter 6: Pull out Rug

## Chapter Purpose and Narrative Function
The hero's ordinary world is destroyed or fundamentally changed, making refusal of the call impossible. This chapter forces the hero into the adventure by removing their ability to stay in the familiar. It's the point of no return that launches the hero definitively into Act 2.

## Key Beats to Hit
- A major event destroys or threatens the hero's ordinary world
- The hero loses their safe retreat and comfortable status quo
- People or things the hero cares about are put at risk
- The hero's previous life becomes impossible to maintain
- Clear demonstration that only accepting the call can solve things
- Hero makes the definitive choice to enter the extraordinary world
- End with the hero crossing the threshold into Act 2

## Character State/Arc Progression
- **Beginning**: Hero is still trying to avoid the call through denial
- **End**: Hero has no choice but to embrace their new role and path
- **Internal Arc**: From reluctant denial to forced acceptance and commitment
- **Skills/Abilities**: First real manifestation of extraordinary abilities or potential
- **Relationships**: Loss of some connections, forging of new ones crucial to the quest

## Conflict Escalation Requirements
- **Level**: Life-Changing/World-Threatening (5-6 out of 10)
- **Type**: Destruction, loss, forced change, immediate danger
- **Stakes**: Everything the hero holds dear, their entire way of life
- **Tension**: Peak tension for Act 1, dramatic reversal of circumstances
- **Opponent**: Antagonistic forces directly attacking the hero's world

## Character Development Focus
- Force the hero to choose their deepest values
- Test their courage when everything is on the line
- Reveal their capacity for sacrifice and heroism
- Show their ability to act decisively under extreme pressure
- Demonstrate their readiness to grow beyond their limitations

## Typical Scene Elements
- Catastrophic event (attack, disaster, revelation)
- Loss of home, family member, or crucial relationship
- Betrayal by someone trusted
- Deadline or ultimatum that can't be ignored
- Rescue or protection of others
- First use of extraordinary abilities
- Crossing into a new physical or metaphorical space

## Word Count Target
**3,000-4,000 words**

## Writing Notes
- Make this the most dramatic and emotionally intense chapter of Act 1
- Ensure the loss feels real and meaningful to the reader
- Show the hero's growth through their response to crisis
- Use action and emotion rather than exposition
- End on a strong forward-moving note that launches Act 2
- Balance tragedy with hope and new possibility
