# Chapter 13: Mirror Stage

## Chapter Purpose and Narrative Function
The hero encounters a character or situation that reflects their own flaws, fears, or potential dark path. This chapter forces introspection and character growth by showing the hero what they could become if they make wrong choices. It often involves facing a dark mirror of themselves or confronting their shadow.

## Key Beats to Hit
- Introduction of a character who mirrors the hero's flaws or potential
- Hero recognizes uncomfortable similarities to themselves
- Confrontation with their own weaknesses or shadow side
- Moment of self-reflection and potential growth
- Choice between the easy/dark path and the difficult/right path
- Supporting characters may point out the similarities
- End with the hero rejecting the mirror's path but understanding the temptation

## Character State/Arc Progression
- **Beginning**: Hero is confident after their commitment in Chapter 12
- **End**: Hero has deeper self-awareness and strengthened moral resolve
- **Internal Arc**: From external focus to internal examination and growth
- **Skills/Abilities**: Understanding that power without wisdom/morality is dangerous
- **Relationships**: Deeper trust with allies who help the hero see clearly

## Conflict Escalation Requirements
- **Level**: Internal/Moral (6-7 out of 10)
- **Type**: Moral temptation, self-confrontation, identity crisis
- **Stakes**: The hero's moral integrity and future path
- **Tension**: Build through the attraction of the easier/darker path
- **Opponent**: The hero's own temptations, fears, and potential for corruption

## Character Development Focus
- Force the hero to confront their capacity for evil or failure
- Show their ability to learn from negative examples
- Reveal their core moral principles under temptation
- Demonstrate their growing wisdom and self-knowledge
- Test their commitment to doing right rather than what's easy

## Typical Scene Elements

- Confronting a villain who was once similar to the hero
- Facing temptation to use dark powers or questionable methods
- Seeing the consequences of choices similar to ones the hero faces
- Intervention by allies who help the hero see clearly

## Word Count Target
**3,000-4,000 words**

## Writing Notes
- Make the mirror character compelling and sympathetic, not just evil
- Show why the dark path is genuinely tempting to the hero
- Use dialogue and interaction to reveal character depth
- Focus on internal struggle rather than external action
- Make the hero's choice feel earned through genuine internal work
- Set up the moral foundation for the challenges ahead
