# Chapter 1: Really Bad Day

## Chapter Purpose and Narrative Function
Establish the protagonist's ordinary world and introduce them at a low point. This chapter shows what the hero's normal life looks like, but emphasizes the problems, frustrations, and limitations they face. The "really bad day" sets up the emotional stakes and makes the reader sympathetic to the hero's plight.

## Key Beats to Hit
- Open with the protagonist in their familiar environment
- Show their daily routine, relationships, and responsibilities
- Introduce a series of mounting problems or frustrations
- Demonstrate the hero's current coping mechanisms (or lack thereof)
- Reveal character flaws, fears, or limiting beliefs
- End with the hero at their lowest point in the ordinary world
- Plant seeds for the larger story conflict

## Character State/Arc Progression
- **Beginning**: Hero is stuck in routine, unaware of their potential
- **End**: Hero is overwhelmed, frustrated, ready for change (though they don't know it yet)
- **Internal Arc**: From complacency to dissatisfaction
- **Skills/Abilities**: Show current competencies and limitations
- **Relationships**: Establish key supporting characters and dynamics

## Conflict Escalation Requirements
- **Level**: Personal/Internal (1-2 out of 10)
- **Type**: Daily life problems, minor setbacks, personal frustrations
- **Stakes**: Comfort, routine, self-esteem
- **Tension**: Build through accumulating small problems rather than one big crisis
- **Opponent**: Circumstances, other people's expectations, the hero's own limitations

## Character Development Focus
- Establish the hero's ordinary world baseline
- Show their strengths and weaknesses
- Reveal their deepest want (what they think they need)
- Hint at their deeper need (what they actually need for growth)
- Demonstrate their current worldview and beliefs

## Typical Scene Elements
- Work/school environment
- Home life or living situation
- Key relationships (family, friends, colleagues)
- Hobbies or interests
- Daily challenges and frustrations

## Word Count Target
**3,000-4,000 words**

## Writing Notes
- Focus on showing rather than telling the character's problems
- Use concrete details to make the ordinary world feel real and lived-in
- Balance sympathy for the hero with acknowledgment of their flaws
- Avoid making the hero completely passive - show them trying to solve problems, even if unsuccessfully
- Plant story questions that will hook the reader
