## ⚡ Quick Guidelines
- ✅ Focus on STRUCTURE and ORGANIZATION for reader experience
- ❌ Avoid content details (that belongs in premise/scenes)
- 📚 Written for manuscript preparation, focusing on format and flow

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every manuscript
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to your publication goals
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this manuscript plan from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS DEVELOPMENT: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something crucial, mark it
3. **Think like a reader**: Every vague element should fail the "clear structure" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - Target word count and chapter lengths
   - Act structure and pacing
   - POV consistency and chapter organization
   - Publishing format requirements
   - Series structure if applicable
   - Front/back matter needs
