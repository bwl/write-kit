# Chapter 2: Something Peculiar

## Chapter Purpose and Narrative Function
Introduce the first hint of the larger story world and conflict. Something unusual happens that doesn't fit with the protagonist's ordinary world, creating intrigue and raising questions. This chapter begins to shift the story from the mundane to the extraordinary, though the hero may not yet recognize the significance.

## Key Beats to Hit
- Present an unusual event, person, or discovery
- Show the hero's reaction to this peculiarity (curiosity, dismissal, concern)

- Plant clues about the extraordinary world the hero will enter
- Show how the peculiar event disrupts the hero's routine
- End with unresolved questions that propel the story forward

## Character State/Arc Progression

- **Opponent**: Unknown forces, mysterious circumstances, possibly helpful strangers

## Character Development Focus
