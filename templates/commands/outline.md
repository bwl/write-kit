The user input to you can be provided directly by the agent or as a command argument - you **MUST** consider it before proceeding with the prompt (if not empty).

User input:

$ARGUMENTS

Given the story concept details provided as an argument, do this:

1. Run `{SCRIPT}` from the repo root and parse JSON for STORY_SPEC, STORY_OUTLINE, SPECS_DIR, BRANCH. All future file paths must be absolute.
   - BEFORE proceeding, inspect STORY_SPEC for a `## Clarifications` section with at least one `Session` subheading. If missing or clearly ambiguous areas remain (vague story elements, unresolved plot choices), PAUSE and instruct the user to run `/clarify` first to reduce rework. Only continue if: (a) Clarifications exist OR (b) an explicit user override is provided (e.g., "proceed without clarification"). Do not attempt to fabricate clarifications yourself.
2. Read and analyze the story specification to understand:
   - The story premise and central themes
   - Character arcs and relationships
   - Plot structure and narrative requirements
   - Genre conventions and reader expectations
   - Any creative constraints or dependencies mentioned

3. Read the constitution at `/memory/constitution.md` to understand constitutional requirements.

4. Execute the story outline template:
   - Load `/templates/outline-template.md` (already copied to STORY_OUTLINE path)
   - Set Input path to STORY_SPEC
   - Run the Execution Flow (main) function steps 1-9
   - The template is self-contained and executable
   - Follow error handling and gate checks as specified
   - Let the template guide artifact generation in $SPECS_DIR:
     * Phase 0 generates research.md
     * Phase 1 generates character-profiles.md, plot-structure/, scene-breakdown.md
     * Phase 2 generates chapter-summaries.md
   - Incorporate user-provided details from arguments into Genre Context: {ARGS}
   - Update Progress Tracking as you complete each phase

5. Verify execution completed:
   - Check Progress Tracking shows all phases complete
   - Ensure all required artifacts were generated
   - Confirm no ERROR states in execution

6. Report results with branch name, file paths, and generated artifacts.

Use absolute paths with the repository root for all file operations to avoid path issues.
