# Chapter 5: Head in Sand

## Chapter Purpose and Narrative Function
The hero's initial refusal of the call to adventure. They attempt to return to their ordinary world and pretend the call never happened, but the story world won't let them ignore their destiny. This chapter shows the hero's fear and reluctance while building pressure for them to ultimately accept their role.

## Key Beats to Hit
- Hero explicitly or implicitly refuses the call
- Attempt to return to normal routine and responsibilities
- Denial or rationalization of the extraordinary events
- Supporting characters may pressure the hero to reconsider
- Escalating signs that avoidance isn't working
- Consequences of refusal begin to manifest
- End with the hero forced to confront that they can't hide forever

## Character State/Arc Progression
- **Beginning**: Hero is overwhelmed and choosing safety over growth
- **End**: Hero realizes avoidance is creating worse problems
- **Internal Arc**: From fear-based denial to reluctant acknowledgment of reality
- **Skills/Abilities**: Suppression of emerging abilities, resistance to growth
- **Relationships**: Strain as others see the hero's potential being wasted

## Conflict Escalation Requirements
- **Level**: Internal/Psychological (3-4 out of 10)
- **Type**: Self-doubt, fear of change, denial of responsibility
- **Stakes**: Personal integrity, missed opportunity, others' safety
- **Tension**: Build through increasing evidence that denial won't work
- **Opponent**: The hero's own fears, external pressure, mounting consequences

## Character Development Focus
- Explore the hero's deepest fears about inadequacy
- Show their attachment to comfort and security
- Reveal what they're afraid of losing if they accept the call
- Demonstrate their capacity for self-deception
- Display the internal conflict between safety and growth

## Typical Scene Elements
- Attempts to resume normal activities
- Rationalizing away extraordinary events
- Conversations where others urge action
- Signs and portents that can't be ignored
- Dreams or visions that intrude on denial
- Worsening of original problems due to inaction
- Moments of temptation to reconsider

## Word Count Target
**3,000-4,000 words**

## Writing Notes
- Make the hero's fear relatable and understandable
- Show the cost of both accepting and refusing the call
- Use external events to mirror the hero's internal conflict
- Build sympathy while showing the futility of denial
- Plant seeds for what will eventually force the hero to accept
- Balance the hero's fear with hints of their hidden strength
