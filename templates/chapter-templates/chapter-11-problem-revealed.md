# Chapter 11: Problem Revealed

## Chapter Purpose and Narrative Function
The deeper, more complex nature of the central problem is revealed. What seemed straightforward becomes complicated by moral ambiguity, hidden connections, or unexpected obstacles. This chapter often introduces the "ticking clock" element and shows that the solution won't be as simple as initially thought.

## Key Beats to Hit
- Discovery that the problem is more complex than first understood
- Revelation of hidden connections or unexpected complications
- Introduction of moral ambiguity or difficult choices
- Time pressure or deadline that creates urgency
- Hero must reconsider their approach or strategy
- Supporting characters may have conflicting opinions on how to proceed
- End with the hero facing a more daunting but clearer challenge

## Character State/Arc Progression
- **Beginning**: Hero thinks they understand the problem and how to solve it
- **End**: Hero grasps the true complexity and moral dimensions of their quest
- **Internal Arc**: From simple certainty to complex understanding
- **Skills/Abilities**: Realization that different skills may be needed than expected
- **Relationships**: Strain as different characters have different solutions

## Conflict Escalation Requirements
- **Level**: Moral/Strategic Complexity (6-7 out of 10)
- **Type**: Ethical dilemmas, strategic complications, hidden obstacles
- **Stakes**: Moral integrity, effectiveness of the solution, time running out
- **Tension**: Build through complexity and impossible choices
- **Opponent**: The complexity of the situation itself, moral ambiguity

## Character Development Focus
- Test the hero's ability to handle moral complexity
- Show their decision-making process under pressure
- Reveal their core values when facing difficult choices
- Demonstrate their ability to adapt strategies and plans
- Display their leadership skills when others disagree

## Typical Scene Elements
- Research or investigation that reveals hidden truths
- Conversations with experts who provide disturbing information
- Discovery of documents, prophecies, or ancient knowledge
- Debate among allies about the right course of action
- Reconnaissance that reveals unexpected obstacles
- Meeting with morally ambiguous characters who offer deals
- Moments of doubt about the rightness of the mission

## Word Count Target
**3,000-4,000 words**

## Writing Notes
- Avoid making the complication feel arbitrary - it should emerge logically
- Use this complexity to deepen character development
- Balance information revelation with emotional impact
- Show how different characters process the new complexity differently
- Set up the moral stakes that will be tested throughout Act 2B
- Make the reader question what the "right" solution actually is
